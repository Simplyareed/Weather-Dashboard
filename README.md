# Weather-Dashboard

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- My motivation for this project was that I wanted to create a five day weather forcast feature using server-side APIs, this aims to equip users with comprehensive weather insights, allowing them to make informed decisions and better prepare for the days ahead.
  The reason for building this project provides a valuable opportunity to develop skills in utilizing server-side APIs and presenting complex data in a user-friendly format. This project will empower users to plan their activities with confidence by providing accurate and reliable weather forecasts for the upcoming days.
The problem that this solves is users can anticipate weather conditions over the upcoming days with greater accuracy. This enables them to plan outdoor activities, events, travel, and daily routines more effectively, ultimately enhancing their overall convenience, preparedness, and ability to make informed decisions based on reliable weather forecasts.
  While working on this project I learned how to incorportate server side API's on top of all the tools that go into making html,javascript,css while implementing bootstrap as well.
